    <h1>Importance of meta tag and Doctypes</h1>

    <p>
        The
        <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data or information about data.
        Meta tags always go inside the head element, and are typically used to specify character set, page desciption,
        keywords, author of metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines
        (keywords), and other web services.
        There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user visible area of a web page),
        through the meta tag

    <h2>Doctype Declaration</h2>
    <p>
        All HTML documents must start with a Doctype declaration.
        The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an information to the browser about what document type to expect.
